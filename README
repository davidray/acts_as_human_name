ActsAsHumanName
===============

Adds two methods to your model:

regular_name: "David Christiansen"
full_name: "Christiansen, David Ray III"


The tests don't work yet. I need to figure out how to include shoulda. Also, you can't configure the names of the columns I use yet. They have to be first_name, last_name, middle_name, and suffix.


Example

acts_as_human_name
